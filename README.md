# Placeholder Repository

This repository holds some text, in markdown format, to be used as placeholder texts. Also useful for git practice.

## Notes

Since in the CV I want tables with headers ordered vertically (key:value), these are written with inline HTML. Repeating blocks are separated with an empty row (\<td colspan=2\>\<td\>).
