# Curriculum Vitae

## Overview

Born in 1994, I got my high school education in a French-speaking high school in Istanbul. In 2013, I went on to study architecture in Italian in the _Polytechnic University of Milan_, and completed my studies in three years— along with an internship in a local office, work in a bookshop in the Triennale of Milan, and various other activities.

I moved to Lisbon in 2016 for a Master's program in _Universidade Autónoma de Lisboa_, and have been living here since: studying and practicing architecture, experimenting with new tools, and taking on the occasional _odd job_ to broaden my horizons (bookbinding & design, music production, architecture models, competitions etc.)

I'm confident about my skills in graphic and modelling programs (such as Illustrator, Autocad, Rhinoceros, Photoshop, Indesign), my language skills, and my knowledge in composition and design in general.

I've also been making music since I was 13 years old, learning programming, practicing drawing and calligraphy, which have all been very important in shaping my architectural work.
